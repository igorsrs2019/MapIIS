This script was created in powershell, its purpose is to assist in mapping sites in IIS (Internet Information Services). It accesses the physical directory of sites and searches for the web.config file. In the console, it informs the total number of sites, the number that have the status "Running" and "Stopped" and exports an IISMap.txt file where it is a compilation of the content of all the web.config found in IIS.
